# AntiSandBox-with-WIFI
Anti-Sandbox with WIFI for Windows.  
If there is more than one WIFI network, it returns "TRUE" if not "FALSE".  
I tested with Cuckoo Sandbox (V2.0.6), ANY.RUN and Falcon Sandbox (V8.10) it works.  
#### But many legitimate computers do not have a wifi card.  
#### This is not really reliable because of the high detection rate.  

Use wlanapi (Native Wifi API) library.
